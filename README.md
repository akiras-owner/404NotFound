This Computer Networking project, created by group: 404-not-found, is a Peer-to-Peer network protocol that allows students to engage in a Scavenger Hunt game. The student who begins the game will be prompted with a set of questions to maneuver through the scavenger hunt, and reach the end. This project was created using Python and Flask, and utlizes UDP and TCP connections to effectively communicate with the server and any joining peers.
